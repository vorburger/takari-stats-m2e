# How do we upload usage statistics

Each active Eclipse workspace will upload statistics to Takari.io server one
time every 7 days. This is done with a single HTTP PUT request, where the body
is JSON encoded usage statistics data.

Usage report is not uploaded if there are no m2e projects in the workspace.

# How to disable the UI prompt asking for permission to upload

Add "-Declipse.m2.stats.allow=true" to eclipse.ini.
